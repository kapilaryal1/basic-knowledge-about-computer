<b><u><h2>Computers are classified into five Generation</h2></u></b>
            <li>First Generation</li>
            <li>Second Generation</li>
            <li>Third Generation</li>
            <li>Fourth Generation</li>
            <li>Fifth Generation</li>
            <u><b><h3>First Generation Of Computer</h3></u></b>
            <i><p>A vacuum-tube computer, now termed a first-generation computer, is a computer that uses vacuum tubes for logic circuitry. <br>  Although superseded by second-generation transistorized computers, vacuum-tube computers continued to be built into the 1960s. These computers were mostly one-of-a-kind designs.</p></i></br>
            <b><p>Feature of First Generation of Computer are as follow:</p></b>
        <li>Use of vacuum tubes to make circuits</li>
        <li>Use of magnetic drums</li>
        <li>Use of machine language and symbols in instructions</li>
        <li>Very small amount of storage space</li>
        <li>Use of punch cards as I/O devices</li>
        <p>Example: UNIVAC I, IBM 650, MARK II, MARK III etc.  </p>
        <u><h3>Second Generation Of Computer</h3></u>
        <i><p>A second-generation computer, through the late 1950s and 1960s featured circuit boards filled with individual transistors and magnetic core memory. These machines remained the mainstream design into the late 1960s, when integrated circuits started appearing and led to the third-generation computer.</p></i>
<b><p>Features OF Second Generation of Computer are as Follow:</p></b>
        <li>Use of transistors</li>
        <li>High speed I/O devices</li>
        <li>Invention and use of high level languages such as Fortran and Cobol.</li>
        <li>Improvement of speed and reliability</li>
        <li>Communication by using telephone line</li>
        <p>Example: Honeywell 200, IBM 1620, IBM 1400 etc.</p>
<u><h3>Third Generation Of Computer</h3></u>
        <i><P>Third generation computers were computers that emerged due to the development of the integrated circuit (IC). They were the first steps toward computers as we know them today. Their main feature was the use of integrated circuits, which allowed them to be shrunk down to be as small as large toasters.</P></i>
        <b><p>Feature of Third Generation Of Computer are as follow:</p></b>
        <li>Use of Integrated Circuits (IC) instead of transistors</li>
        <li>Use of Semi-conductor memory</li>
        <li>Small size than previous generation computers</li>
        <li>Use of monitors and line printers</li>
        <li>Use of high level programming languages</li>
        <p>Examples: IBM 360, IBM 370, PDP-11 etc.</p>
        <u><h3>Fourth Generation Of Computer</h3></u>
        <i><p>The period of fourth generation was from 1971-1980. Computers of fourth generation used Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits. VLSI circuits having about 5000 transistors and other circuit elements with their associated circuits on a single chip made it possible to have microcomputers of fourth generation.</p></i>
<b><p>Features Of Fourth Generation Of Computer are as follow:</p></b>
        <li>Microprocessor based system that uses Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits.</li>
        <li>Microcomputers became the cheapest at this generation.</li>
        <li>Outputs are now more reliable and accurate.</li>
        <li>Processing power or speed has increased enormously.</li>
        <li>Storage of memory and other storage devices has increased in big amount.</li>
        <p>Example: IBM 3033, Sharp PC â€“ 1211 etc.</p>
        <u><h3>Fifth Generation Of Computer</u></h3>
        <i><p>Computers from fourth generation are in use of everyday work. Fifth generation computers are from the future. Actually the computers from fifth generation are already in use under limited exposure and not available for everyone to try as the development process is still ongoing. A few of the characteristics of those fifth generation computers are already in practice or available in the fourth generation computers but those are either not complete nor available for everyone. Following are some of the characteristics of fifth generation computers.</p></i>
<b><p>Feature Of Fifth Generation OF Computer are as follow:</p></b>
        <li>Multi-processor based system</li>
        <li>Use of Artificial Intelligence</li>
        <li>Use of optical fiber in circuits</li>
        <li>Huge development of storage</li>
        <li>More powerful micro and macro computers</li>
